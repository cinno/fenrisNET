This program (fenrisNET) was developed and tested under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

I. To run this program with full functionality you need some third party programs:
[x] pyinstaller 2.1
[x] python-2.7.8.msi
[x] pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe
[x] wine >= 1.6.2
[x] virtual-wine 0.1

II. Most of this programs you can automatically install using the setup script in this folder (setup.py)
python setup.py -h

If you have any problems with cross compiling in context of this software or the setup script does not work, perform the following commands:
1. Download python-2.7.8.msi and pywin32-218.win32-py27.exe
2. install wine
3. git clone https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller
4. git clone https://github.com/htgoebel/virtual-wine.git
5. apt-get install scons
6. ./virtual-wine/vwine-setup venv_wine (choose windows 7 at the end)
7. . venv_wine/bin/activate
8. wine msiexec -i python-2.7.8.msi
9. wine pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe

III. To run the control panel you need a webserver with PHP functionality.
1. Run the setup script with -p option
2. You may have to set "AllowOverride All" inside the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to enable the htaccess file.
3. Then you only have to copy all files and folders from the panel folder inside your webservers www folder.
4. Access the panel by calling the URL: http://YOURWEBSERVER/orders.php (standard password: "password").
